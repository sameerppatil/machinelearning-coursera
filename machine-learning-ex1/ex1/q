 -- Function File: debug ()
     Summary of debugging commands.  For more information on each
     command and available options use 'help CMD'.

     The debugging commands available in Octave are

     'dbstop'
          Add a breakpoint.

     'dbclear'
          Remove a breakpoint.

     'dbstatus'
          List all breakpoints.

     'dbwhere'
          Report the current file and line number where execution is
          stopped.

     'dbtype'
          Display the code of the function being debugged, enumerating
          the line numbers.

     'dblist'
          List 10 lines of code centered around the line number where
          execution is stopped.

     'dbstep'
     'dbnext'
          Execute (step) one or more lines, follow execution into (step
          into) a function call, or execute until the end of a function
          (step out), and re-enter debug mode.

     'dbcont'
          Continue normal code execution from the debug prompt.

     'dbquit'
          Quit debugging mode immediately and return to the main prompt.

     'dbstack'
          Print a backtrace of the execution stack.

     'dbup'
          Move up the execution stack.

     'dbdown'
          Move down the execution stack.

     'keyboard'
          Force entry into debug mode from an m-file.

     'debug_on_error'
          Configure whether Octave enters debug mode when it encounters
          an error.

     'debug_on_warning'
          Configure whether Octave enters debug mode when it encounters
          a warning.

     'debug_on_interrupt'
          Configure whether Octave enters debug mode when it encounters
          an interrupt.

     'isdebugmode'
          Return true if in debug mode.

     When Octave encounters a breakpoint, or other reason to enter debug
     mode, the prompt changes to "debug>".  The workspace of the
     function where the breakpoint was encountered becomes available and
     any Octave command that is valid in that workspace context may be
     executed.
